# DataViz_Streamlit_PW5_T1

We worked on a HR Analytics dataset that provides information about people looking for a job.

We first planned our data cleaning and visualization process on Jira and created our Github repo.

We cleaned and prepared the data for visualization.

We created 12 charts to visualize the data. First 8 charts give insights about the data we have. 
Last 4 charts show our analysis about likeliness of people to look for a new job. 

We then created our dashboard on Streamlit with these charts. 

We deployed our Streamlit dashboard to Heroku.
